# Arrays

This folder contains a collection of C++ programs focused on arrays and their various operations. Each program demonstrates different techniques for manipulating arrays, providing a comprehensive overview of array handling in C++.

## Overview

Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming, allowing the storage and manipulation of multiple elements of the same type. This collection aims to cover a wide range of operations that can be performed on arrays, such as:

- Input and output of array elements
- Dynamic memory allocation for arrays
- Summation and averaging of array elements
- Searching for and sorting elements within arrays
- Merging multiple arrays
- Reversing the order of elements in arrays
- Rotating array elements
- Checking specific properties of arrays (e.g., sparse matrices)
- Finding the largest elements within arrays

## Key Concepts

### Static Arrays
Static arrays have a fixed size determined at compile time. Programs involving static arrays demonstrate how to declare, initialize, and access array elements using nested loops and simple input/output operations.

### Dynamic Arrays
Dynamic arrays allow for flexible memory management, allocating space at runtime. Programs in this category showcase techniques for creating, manipulating, and deallocating dynamic arrays using pointers and the `new` and `delete` operators.

### Multi-dimensional Arrays
Multi-dimensional arrays extend the concept of arrays to multiple dimensions, useful for representing matrices and tables. These programs illustrate how to work with 2D arrays, including element input/output and checking matrix properties.

### Array Operations
Various operations on arrays such as merging, rotating, reversing, and finding specific elements are demonstrated. These programs highlight common algorithms and techniques for processing arrays efficiently.

### Utility Functions
Some programs include utility functions for specific tasks like calculating the sum and average of array elements, finding the largest elements, and checking matrix properties. These functions emphasize the importance of modular programming and code reuse.

## Usage

To run any of the programs in this folder:

1. Open the C++ file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).
3. Execute the compiled program and follow the on-screen instructions for input.

## Contributions

Contributions to this collection are welcome. If you have a program that demonstrates a unique array operation or an optimization of an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request.
