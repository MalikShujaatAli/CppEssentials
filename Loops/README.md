# Loops

Welcome to the "Loops" folder of **CppEssentials**! This folder is dedicated to helping you understand and master the fundamental concept of loops in C++ programming. Whether you're just starting out or looking to solidify your knowledge, you'll find a variety of programs here to aid your learning.

## Overview

Loops are a crucial part of programming that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. This folder includes examples of different types of loops, such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. By studying these examples, you can learn how to implement loops effectively in your programs.

## What's Included

Explore a range of programs that cover key looping concepts such as:
- **For Loops**: Learn how to use `for` loops for iterating a specific number of times.
- **While Loops**: Understand how to repeat a block of code while a condition remains true.
- **Do-While Loops**: Discover how to ensure a block of code runs at least once before the condition is checked.
- **Nested Loops**: See how to implement loops within loops for more complex iterations.
- **Loop Control Statements**: Get to know how to use `break` and `continue` to control loop execution.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the "Loops" folder, dive into any program that catches your eye. Each program is designed to provide clear examples and explanations, enabling you to learn at your own pace. Here are a few steps to get you started:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MalikShujaatAli/CppEssentials.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Loops Folder**: Open the `loops` folder to access the programs.
   ```sh
   cd CppEssentials/loops
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Programs**: Use a C++ compiler to compile and run the programs.
   ```sh
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ./program_name
   ```
