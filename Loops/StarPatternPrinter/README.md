# StarPatternPrinter

## Overview

StarPatternPrinter is a simple C++ program that prints a right-aligned triangle of stars. The user is prompted to input the number of lines (between 1 and 40), and the program then displays the corresponding pattern of stars.

## Features

- Prompts the user for the number of star lines to print.
- Validates user input to ensure it's within the range of 1 to 40.
- Clears the console screen before printing the pattern.
- Prints a right-aligned triangle of stars.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (such as GCC or MSVC)
- A terminal or command prompt to run the executable

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
g++ -o StarPatternPrinter StarPatternPrinter.cpp
```

### Running the Program

After compiling, run the program with:

```sh
./StarPatternPrinter
```

### User Input

When the program runs, it will prompt you to enter the number of star lines to be printed:

```
Enter the number of star lines (1 to 40) to be printed: 
```

- If you enter a number between 1 and 40, the program will print the star pattern.
- If you enter a number outside this range, the program will prompt you again until a valid number is entered.

### Example

For an input of 5, the program will output:

```
Enter the number of star lines (1 to 40) to be printed: 5

                                       * * 
                                      * * * 
                                     * * * * 
                                    * * * * * 
```

## Code Explanation

### Functions

- `void printStars(int blanks, int starsInLine)`: Prints a line with a specified number of leading blanks followed by a specified number of stars.
- `int main()`: The main function that handles user input, validation, and calls `printStars` to print each line of the star pattern.

## Platform Compatibility

The `system("cls")` command is used to clear the screen on Windows. If you are using a UNIX-based system like Linux or macOS, replace `system("cls")` with `system("clear")`.
