# String Operations in C++

This folder is dedicated to programs that demonstrate various string operations in C++. It includes a wide range of examples that showcase different techniques for handling strings, both as character arrays and using the C++ string class. These programs cover fundamental concepts and common operations involving strings, such as searching, replacing, counting, and manipulating string data.

## Contents

- **Character Arrays**: Examples of handling strings using character arrays, including basic operations like searching for characters, replacing characters, and reversing strings.
- **C++ String Class**: Demonstrations of using the C++ string class for more complex string manipulations and operations.
- **String Algorithms**: Implementations of common string algorithms, such as finding substrings, comparing strings, and calculating string lengths.
- **User Input**: Programs that take string input from the user and perform various operations on the input data.
- **Memory Management**: Examples showing dynamic memory allocation for strings and proper memory management practices.

## How to Use
Each program in this folder is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently. To compile a program, use a C++ compiler such as `g++`:

```sh
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
./program_name
```

Replace `program_name` with the actual name of the program file you wish to compile and run.
